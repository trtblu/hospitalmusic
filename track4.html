<p>I've been waiting on a war since I was young
<br>Since I was a little boy with a toy gun
<br>Never really wanted to be number one
<br>Just wanted to love everyone
<br>
<br>Is there more to this than that?
<br>Is there more to this than that?
<br>Is there more to this than that?
<br>Is there more to this
<br>More to this, more to this than
<br>
<br>Just waiting on a war?
<br>Just waiting on a war?
<br>
<br>Every day waiting for the sky to fall
<br>Big crash on a world that's so small
<br>Just a boy with nowhere left to go
<br>Fell in love with a voice on the radio
<br>
<br>Is there more to this than that?
<br>Is there more to this than that?
<br>Is there more to this than that?
<br>Is there more to this
<br>More to this, more to this than
<br>
<br>Just waiting on a war?
<br>Just waiting on a war?
<br>
<br>Just waiting on a war for this and that
<br>There's got to be more to this than that
<br>Just waiting on a war for this and that
<br>There's got to be more to this than that
<br>
<br>I've been waiting on a war since I was young
<br>Since I was a little boy with a toy gun
<br>
<br>Is there more to this
<br>More to this, more to this than
<br>
<br>Just waiting on a war?
<br>Just waiting on a war?
<br>
<br>Just waiting on a war for this and that
<br>There's got to be more to this than that
<br>Just waiting on a war for this and that
<br>There's got to be more to this than that
<br>Just waiting on a war for this and that
<br>There's got to be more to this than that
<br>Just waiting on a war for this and that
<br>There's got to be more to this than that
<br>
<br>'Cause I need more
<br>Yeah, I need more
<br>Just waiting on a war
<br>Just waiting on a war
<br>Yeah, I need more (for this and that)
<br>(There's got to be more to this than that)
<br>Yeah, I need more (just waiting on a war, for this and that)
<br>(There's got to be more to this than that)
<br>Just waiting on a war</p>
