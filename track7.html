<p>I got this thing and I've been taking it out on you
<br>Taking it out on you, oh you
<br>Like a machine that's always breaking down on you
<br>Breaking down on you, so true
<br>
<br>I spin around, around, around
<br>Spin around, around, around
<br>Spin around, around
<br>Out of the blue
<br>
<br>Holding the poison down
<br>Holding the poison down
<br>Something to drown you out
<br>I'm holding the poison down
<br>You know I want what I want, I get what I get
<br>I know what I need, I know what I said
<br>Holding the poison down
<br>Holding the poison down
<br>
<br>I get the feeling there ain't nothing that I can do
<br>Nothing will get me through, so blue
<br>Sometimes I dream, I can dream, I can dream
<br>And then I bleed, and I bleed, and I bleed
<br>I get the feeling that there's nothing that I can do
<br>
<br>I spin around, around, around
<br>Spin around, around, around
<br>Spin around, around
<br>Out of the blue
<br>
<br>Holding the poison down
<br>Holding the poison down
<br>Something to drown you out
<br>I'm holding the poison down
<br>You know I want what I want, I get what I get
<br>I know what I need, I know what I said
<br>Holding the poison down
<br>Holding the poison down
<br>
<br>Stand around, around, around
<br>Stand around, around, around
<br>Stand around, around
<br>Out of the blue
<br>
<br>Holding the poison down
<br>Holding the poison down
<br>Something to drown you out
<br>I'm holding the poison down
<br>You know I want what I want, I get what I get
<br>I know what I need, I know what I said
<br>Holding the poison down
<br>Holding the poison down</p>
